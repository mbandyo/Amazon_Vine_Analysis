# Amazon Vine Analysis
This project analyzes book reviews in Amazon through Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.
In this project we had access to approximately 50 datasets. Each one contains reviews of a specific product, from clothing apparel to wireless products. The project team selected one of these datasets( a book review) and use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Then SQL was used to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset. Then, you’ll write a summary of the analysis for Jennifer to submit to the SellBy stakeholders.
